/**
 * JavaScript can’t answer questions. But there are some questions that
 * JavaScript would be delighted to answer. These questions have a special
 * name—they are called expressions.
 *
 * JavaScript answers expressions in the only way it knows how—with values.
 *
 * Expressions always result in a single value.
 *
 * Rules of Assignment:
 *  • The left side of an assignment must be a “wire”—such as the pet variable.
 *  • The right side of an assignment must be an expression, so it always
 *    results in a value. Our expression can be something simple, like 2 or
 *    'hello'. It can also be a more complicated expression.

/* If we “ask” the expression 2 + 2, JavaScript will “answer” with the value 4 */
console.log(2 + 2);
