/**
 * Rules of Assignment:
 *  • The left side of an assignment must be a “wire”—such as the pet variable.
 *  • The right side of an assignment must be an expression (question to ask),
 *    so it always results in a value. Our expression can be a more complicated
 *    expression, or something simple, like 2 or 'hello'.
 *
 * Simple expressions are called literals—because we literally write down the
 * values that they result in.
