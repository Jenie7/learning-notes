/**
 * Notes
 *
 * If an operand is not a boolean, itâ€™s converted to a boolean
 * for the evaluation.
 *
 * || returns the first truthy value or the last one if no truthy
 * value is found.
 *
 * && returns the first falsy value or the last value if
 * none were found.
 *
 * Precedence of AND && is higher than OR ||, and the precedence
 * of NOT ! is the highest of all logical operators.
