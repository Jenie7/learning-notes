# Different types of decimal numbers

- Integers are floating-point numbers without a fraction.
  They can either be positive or negative, e.g. 10, 400, or -5.

- Floating point numbers (floats) have decimal points and decimal places,
  for example 12.5, and 56.7786543.

- Doubles are a specific type of floating point number that have greater
  precision than standard floating point numbers (meaning that they are
  accurate to a greater number of decimal places).

const myInt = 5;
const myFloat = 6.667;

console.log(typeof myInt);
console.log(typeof myFloat);

/*

We even have different types of number systems! Decimal is base 10
(meaning it uses 0–9 in each column), but we also have things like:

- Binary — The lowest level language of computers; 0s and 1s.

- Octal — Base 8, uses 0–7 in each column.

- Hexadecimal — Base 16, uses 0–9 and then a–f in each column.You may
  have encountered these numbers before when setting colors in CSS.
