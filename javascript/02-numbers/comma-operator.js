/*

The comma operator allows us to evaluate several expressions, dividing
them with a comma ,. Each of them is evaluated but only the result of the
last one is returned.

# Comma has a very low precedence

Please note that the comma operator has very low precedence, lower than
=, so parentheses are important in the example above.
Without them: a = 1 + 2, 3 + 4 evaluates + first, summing the numbers
into a = 3, 7, then the assignment operator = assigns a = 3, and the rest
is ignored. Itâ€™s like (a = 1 + 2), 3 + 4.
